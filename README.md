# Ollama Embedding Issue Ops

Automation isn't just for builds and deployments anymore, lets build something fun with it. In this project, we'll explore how to turn GitHub Issues into a creative workflow using Issue Ops. We'll leverage Ollama to generate text embeddings, visualize them as vector images, and automatically display these images in the issue itself.

## What we need
To follow along, start with the Ollama Devcontainer GitHub template, which comes pre-configured with Python and Ollama.
You'll just need to add the following Python libraries to your requirements.txt file:
```
scikit-learn
numpy
matplotlib
```
This will set up your environment for embedding text and visualizing vector images.
